## Technology Stack

This project was built using the following technologies:

- React: a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- React Hook Form: a lightweight form library for React
- React Router Dom: a routing library for React

## Why React Hook Form instead of Redux Form?

For this project, I chose React Hook Form over Redux Form for several reasons:

- **Simplicity**: React Hook Form is a lightweight and simple library for building forms in React. It has a minimal API and requires less configuration, making it faster to set up and use.

- **Performance**: React Hook Form is designed for optimal performance. It uses uncontrolled components and avoids unnecessary re-renders, resulting in faster and smoother form interactions.

- **Flexibility**: React Hook Form provides a flexible and extensible API for building complex forms. It allows you to easily create custom form fields and validation rules, and integrates well with other libraries and tools.
